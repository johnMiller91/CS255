Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for the client DriverPass. The system is an online service that provides the user with the option to purchase one of three tiers that allow them access to driving lessons, online lessons, and quizzes to aid students who are pursuing their driver's license. I captured the needs and the requirements of the system well as we progressed through the design documents.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Some of my UML notation, notably in the activity diagram, is inconsistent with standards. To have a consistent easy to read diagram I would refactor these so that they are inline with UML notation.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The system must reach the client's/user's needs to be successful. I was able to interpret these needs through interviews and other documents provided by the client and researching similar systems. These are vital to the success of a system. Without realizing the user's needs the system would be unusable to achieve the goal that it set out to fill.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I use a cyclical approach to designing software. I first analyze the goals and requirements of the system. I then design a system fulfilling these goals. Finally, I test and implement the system. I return to each phase of the process as the project progresses ensuring each step fulfills the user's needs.
